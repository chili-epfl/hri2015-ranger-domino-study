	title = {Long-term Interactions with Empathic Social Robots},
	abstract = {In this dissertation, we investigate the role of empathy in social robotic companions. In particular, our aim is to study the e↵ects of an empathic model in long-term interactions between users and social robots. The inputs of the proposed empathic model are the user’s affective state and contextual information of the task that the robot is performing with the user. Considering a database of several empathic and supportive behaviours available to display, the model includes a decision-making mechanism that allows the robot to select the most appropriate empathic behaviours based on the history of inter- actions with that user. By adapting its behaviour to the preferences of a particular user, we expect to improve the relationship between the robot and the user.
The proposed model was developed using an iterative approach, being continuously evaluated and refined through several user studies. Overall, the results raise the possi- bility of a link between empathy and higher perceived social presence, engagement, help, and self-validation in users who interact with social robots for extended periods of time. This means that empathic robots will be more likely to engage users during long-term interactions.},

Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for {HCI} designers.},

In contrast, many human-robot interaction ({HRI)} tasks are dynamic and unstructured, occurring in the open world. It is our belief that methods developed for the measurement and modeling of trust in traditional automation need alteration in order to be useful for {HRI.} Therefore, it is important to characterize the factors in {HRI} that influence trust. This study focused on the influence of changing autonomy reliability. Participants experienced a set of challenging robot handling scenarios that forced autonomy use and kept them focused on autonomy performance. The counterbalanced experiment included scenarios with different low reliability windows so that we could examine how drops in reliability altered trust and use of autonomy. Drops in reliability were shown to affect trust, the frequency and timing of autonomy mode switching, as well as participants' self-assessments of performance. A regression analysis on a number of robot, personal, and scenario factors revealed that participants tie trust more strongly to their own actions rather than robot performance.},

However, trust is traditionally measured post-run, thereby masking the real-time changes in trust, reducing sensitivity to factors like inertia, and subjecting the measure to biases like the primacy-recency effect. Likewise, little is known on how feedback of robot confidence interacts in real-time with trust and control allocation strategies. An experiment to examine these issues showed trust loss due to early reliability drops is masked in traditional post-run measures, trust demonstrates inertia, and feedback alters allocation strategies independent of trust.

To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human–robot interaction.},

	abstract = {Although it is the focus of a growing number of scholars in communication, computer science, psychology, and cognitive science, there is little agreement concerning the nature and measurement of presence. Marvin Minsky (1980) used the term \&quot;telepresence \&quot; to refer to teleoperation technology that provides the user with a \&quot;remote presence \&quot; in a different location via feedback systems that allow her to \&quot;see and feel what is happening \&quot; there. In 1991, the term was adapted and shortened when the journal Presence ({MIT} Press) was founded to provide a forum for \&quot;current research and advanced ideas on teleoperators and virtual environments. \&quot; By 1997 a review, by Lombard and Ditton identified six different conceptualizations of presence in a diverse set of literatures: presence as social richness (the \&quot;warmth \&quot; or \&quot;intimacy \&quot; possible via a medium), realism (perceptual and/or social), transportation (the sensations of \&quot;you are there, \&quot; \&quot;it is here, \&quot; and/or \&quot;we are together\&quot;), immersion (in a mediated environment), social actor within medium (e.g., parasocial interaction), and medium as social actor (e.g., treating computers as social entities). The authors incorporated all of these conceptualizations of presence into a single definition: \&quot;the perceptual illusion of nonmediation. \&quot; The term \&quot;perceptual \&quot; indicates that this phenomenon involves continuous (real time) responses of the human sensory, cognitive, and affective processing systems to objects and entities in a person's environment.

Evidence is reviewed in which 12- to 15-month-old infants treat certain non-human objects as if they have perceptual/attentional abilities, communicative abilities and goal-directed behaviour. They will follow the attentional orientation of an amorphously shaped novel object if it interacts contingently with them or with another person. They also seem to use a novel object's environmentally directed behaviour to determine its perceptual/attentional orientation and object-oriented goals. Results from adults and children with autism are strikingly similar, despite adults' contradictory beliefs about the objects in question and the failure of children with autism to ultimately develop more advanced theory-of-mind reasoning.
